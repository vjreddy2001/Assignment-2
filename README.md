# MyBank
## Automating Day Job with Python
### Background
Welcome to the world of Python programming. I will be using some of the concepts that I learned to complete the PyBank casestudy. 

## To Begin with
  1) I created a new GitHub repo and cloned it to my computer.
  
  2) In my local git repository, I created a directory named **PyBank**.
  3) Using JupyterLab I created a .ipynb file to write the pyton code.
  4) Named the file as **FinalAssig_2a**
  5) I pushed all the changes to GitHub
