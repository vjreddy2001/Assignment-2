## Automating Day Job using Python
### Background
Welcome to the world of Python programming. I will be using some of the concepts of Python that I learned to complete the PyBank casestudy related to the company ABC Inc. The datadet I will be using is from Jan 2010 to Feb 2017.

## To Begin with
  1) I created a new GitHub repo and cloned it to my computer.
  
  2) In my local git repository, I created a directory named **PyBank**.
  3) Using JupyterLab I created a .ipynb file to write the pyton code.
  4) Named the file as **FinalAssig_2a**
  5) I pushed all the changes to GitHub

In this casestudy, I will be creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of ABC Inc. The required Financial dataset is in this file: [revenue_data.csv](revenue_data.csv). This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. 

I will be creating a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following :

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The resulting analysis will look similar to the following:

  
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  
  Total: $38382578
  
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
